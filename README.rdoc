= Daniel Hahlers Dot Files

These are config files to set up a system the way I like it.


== Installation

  git clone git://github.com/blueyed/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
  cd ~/.dotfiles
  rake install


== Environment

I primarily use zsh on Linux, but this is setup for generic shells
(like bash) as well. 

If you would like to switch to zsh, you can do so with 
the following command:

  chsh -s /bin/zsh


== Z Shell

zsh is setup via a oh-my-zsh Git submodule.
